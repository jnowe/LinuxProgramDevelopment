1. Examine malloc() behaviour:
   write a program that uses mallinfo() and malloc_stats() to examine system
   allocation behaviour. Allocate a small, medium, large and observe allocation.
   use mallopt() to turn off memory mapping or to change threshold between the
   2 techniques.

2. Running out of Memory
   write a program that allocates memory in chunks until the system can no
   longer obtain any more. Eventually the OOM Killer should be invoked.
   Examine /var/log/messages to see which processes were exterminated
   Try this with swap turned on/off. (as root 'swapoff -a' / 'swapon -a')
