Unix I/O:
  Basic file ops, unbuffered (not the standard I/O)
    open(), close(), read(), write(), lseek()

  Files are referenced by 'file descriptors', unsigned integers,
  unlike the *FILE strean type used by the standard IO.
  By default 3 file descriptors are connected:
	0 = STDIN_FILENO
	1 = STDOUT_FILENO
	2 - STDERR_FILENO
