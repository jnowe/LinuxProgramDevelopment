Unix I/O:
  Basic file ops, unbuffered (not the standard I/O)
    open(), close(), read(), write(), lseek()

  Files are referenced by 'file descriptors', unsigned integers,
  unlike the *FILE strean type used by the standard IO.
  By default 3 file descriptors are connected:
	0 = STDIN_FILENO
	1 = STDOUT_FILENO
	2 - STDERR_FILENO

  Positional I/O functions: pread(), pwrite() woork without
  advancing the offset. Used in multi-threaded programs.

  Vector I/O perform scatter/gather operations on a chain of
  of buffers in one system call, increasing efficiency.

  Standard I/O (ANSI C):
	FILE *fopen (char *path, char *mode)
	FILE *fdopen (int fildes, char *mode)
	FILE *freopen (char *path, char *mod, FILE *stream)
	...
  The FILE structure is not meant to be poked into :)
